#Oaze.io - Frontend Dev Task

We want to learn about how you approach development and learn more about your skills. To do that we have prepared a small task based on our initial MVP mocks. The task does not have to be fully complete to be submitted. 
 

### Guides: 

- Please feel free to add some creativity where you want to make a task more fun and approachable or entertaining. 

- We expect by delivering a task you will demonstrate good polished UI. 

- Animations would be a plus.

- You are free to approach any part of the task and put as much effort into it as you please.

- All the assumptions you will take along the task should be communicated along with the result.  

- You are free to pick web frontend technology of your choice.

- Please deliver the solution as a git repository but not PR to our repository hosted on GitHub.
